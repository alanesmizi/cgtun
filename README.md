# CableGuard TUN

**CableGuard TUN** is an implementation of the [WireGuard<sup>Â®</sup>](https://www.wireguard.com/) protocol with Rich Online Digital Tokens (RODT). RODT are an implementation of non-fungible tokens that contain all the configuration, identity, and subscription information for Cableguard TUN endpoints. Cableguard TUN is based on Cloudflare's Borintung, a Rust implememtation of Wireguard. 
This project is part of a large ecosystem (Cableguard FORGE, Cableguard TOOL, Cableguard WALLET, Cableguard FIND and Cableguard AUTH), and consists of three parts:

* The executable `cableguard-cli`, a [userspace WireGuard](https://www.wireguard.com/xplatform/) implementation for Linux and macOS.
* The library `cableguard` that implements the underlying WireGuard protocol, without the network or tunnel stacks that need to be that need to be implemented in a platform idiomatic way.
* The rodtwallet.sh scripts (temporary implementation of Cableguard WALLET) that works with the NEAR CLI interface. It provides barebones command line crytographic commands for the management of RODT and NEAR implicit accounts.

### Installation
At this time, you can only install from source code.

### Building

- Library only: `cargo build --lib --no-default-features --release` (Not tested)
- Executable: `cargo build --bin cableguard-cli --release`

By default the executable is placed in the `./target/release` folder. You can copy it to a desired location manually, or install it using `cargo install --bin cableguard --path .`.

### Running
To start a tunnel use:
`cableguard-cli [-f/--foreground] <filewithaccount.json>`

Where <filewithaccount.json> is a NEAR implicit account created with ./wallet/rodtwallet.sh genaccount

It may be possible to use with [wg-quick](https://git.zx2c4.com/WireGuard/about/src/tools/man/wg-quick.8) by setting the environment variable `WG_QUICK_USERSPACE_IMPLEMENTATION` to `cableguard`. For example:
`sudo WG_QUICK_USERSPACE_IMPLEMENTATION=cableguard-cli WG_SUDO=1 wg-quick up CONFIGURATION`

## Supported platforms
It has only been tested in AMD/Intel

#### Linux
`x86-64` architecture is supported. The behaviour should be identical to that of [wireguard-go](https://git.zx2c4.com/wireguard-go/about/), with the following difference:

`cableguard` will drop privileges when started. When privileges are dropped it is not possible to set `fwmark`. If `fwmark` is required, such as when using `wg-quick`, run with `--disable-drop-privileges` or set the environment variable `WG_SUDO=1`.

You will need to give the executable the `CAP_NET_ADMIN` capability using: `sudo setcap cap_net_admin+epi cableguard`.

#### FFI bindings (This has not been tested)
The library exposes a set of C ABI bindings, those are defined in the `wireguard_ffi.h` header file. The C bindings can be used with C/C++, Swift (using a bridging header) or C# (using [DLLImport](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.runtime.interopservices.dllimportattribute?view=netcore-2.2) with [CallingConvention](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.runtime.interopservices.dllimportattribute.callingconvention?view=netcore-2.2) set to `Cdecl`).

#### JNI bindings (This has not been tested)
The library exposes a set of Java Native Interface bindings, those are defined in `src/jni.rs`.
